<h1 id="gsa-sam-connector">GSA-SAM-Connector</h1>
<p>Power Platform Custom Connector for the GSA Per Diem (<a href="https://open.gsa.gov/api/perdiem/">https://open.gsa.gov/api/perdiem/</a>). This is a Power Platform custom connector for interacting with the US Governmentâ€™s General Servies Administration (GSA) Per Diem tables. This is a database of US Government allowed travel expenses and amounts, by location.<br>
All amounts are in US Dollars.  All years are 4-digit years.  All status use standard 2-letter state codes.</p>
<h1 id="api-key">API Key</h1>
<p>All calls to the GSA SAM API require an API key.  The process for betting that API is described on the GSA API site here: <a href="https://open.gsa.gov/api/perdiem/">https://open.gsa.gov/api/perdiem/</a><br>
This will provide an API key that you will need to create a connection with this custom connector.  These API keys are shared across GSA APIs.  If you have created an API key for a different GSA API, it should work for this use too.</p>
<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
<p>Lodging per diem amounts are returned along side a month array in a structure that looks like this:<br>
For each city the API returns an <strong>array</strong> of months identified as:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Returned</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Month Number</td>
<td>number</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lodging Per Diem</td>

<td>100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>For each city, the meal per diem is returned in a structure like this:</p>
